        [own arguments] : requires it's own set of arguments. They are always placed first before other arguments
        [in database] : all elements must be in the database
        [not in database] : all elements must not be in the database

    [html]g [data arguments compatible] [in database]
        MangaScrap will generate the HTML
        should no arguments be passed, only the manga indexes will be updated
        should [data arguments] be passed, all selected elements will have there HTML generated. The index is also generated

    [delete]g [data arguments compatible] [elements required] [in database]

        [param]g can take 3 arguments :

            [list]y
                Shows the status of all the current settings and there description

            [reset]y
                Resets all the values of all the parameters to there default configuration
                Will request a confirmation

            [set]y paramId newValue
                Allows you to set a new value to one of the parameters.
                Requires 2 arguments : the paramId and the new value
                The param ids can be found using [param]g [list]y
                note : changing the destination directory does NOT move the already downloaded elements

    [help]g
        [help]y will display these instructions

    [version]g
        displays the current version of MangaScrap witch can be found in utils/version.txt

    [data arguments]
        definition : the data arguments are the arguments that are used to get elements by [link]y, [id]y, [file]y, ...

        [all]y
            Selects all elements in the database

        [id]y name site
            Gets one element with the combination of the name and of the site.
            The name MUST be the one of the url

        [link]y link
            Gets one element with the complete link of the element

        [file]y fileName
            Gets all the element present in the file
            All the elements must be of the name + site format
            Empty lines are not a problem
            It is possible to place comments but the commented line MUST start with a #

        [query]y query
            Allows you to get elements from the database directly
            Currently just a placeholder

 EXAMPLES :

 ./MangaScrap.rb [add]g [id]y super_manga super_site
    adds 'super_manga' of 'super_site' to the database for future update

 ./MangaScrap.rb [add]g [file]y my_manga_list.txt
    adds all mangas of 'my_manga_list.txt' to the database for future update

 ./MangaScrap.rb [update]g [all]y
    updates all mangas in database

 ./MangaScrap.rb [update]g [file]y file.txt
    updates all mangas in file.txt

 ./MangaScrap.rb [redl]g [p]y 1 [c]y 1 [id]y super_manga super_site
    re-downloads the page 1 of the chapter 1 of the super_manga from the super_site

 ./MangaScrap.rb [param]g [set]y mp /home/toto/
    sets the path of the destination directory to /home/toto

 note : the instructions can also be chained

 ./MangaScrap.rb [version]g [add]g [file]y file.txt [update]g [all]y
    this will make MangaScrap display it's current version, add the content of file.txt to the database
    and then update everything

 note : MangaScrap is smart enough to allow names such as 'id' or 'update'

 ./MangaScrap.rb [add]g [id]y id mangafox [update]g [file]y update
    this will add the manga 'id' of mangafox and then will update all elements contained in the 'update' file

 ex : "bleach" => http://mangafox.me/manga/bleach/ => "bleach"
 ex : "black clover" => http://mangafox.me/manga/black_clover/ => "black_clover"
